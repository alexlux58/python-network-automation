Notes on the Switch Configuration:
Hostname and Basic Security: Sets a unique hostname and encrypts passwords.
Console and VTY Line Security: Configures secure access for console and remote terminal lines, including SSH for remote access.
SNMP, NTP, and Syslog: Configures management protocols for monitoring, time synchronization, and logging.
VLANs: Sets up VLANs for data and voice traffic.
Interface Settings: Configures interfaces for access or trunk mode, assigns VLANs, and enables spanning-tree features.
Security Features: Enables SSH version 2 for secure access and sets up basic ACLs.
DHCP Snooping and Port Security: Provides additional security measures against common attacks like DHCP spoofing and MAC flooding.
Tailoring the Configuration:
Adapt to Your Network: Modify VLAN numbers, interface ranges, and other specifics to match your network's design.
Compliance with Policies: Align the configuration with your organization's security policies and standards.
Testing: Before deploying in a production environment, thoroughly test the configuration in a lab or test environment.

Notes on the Router Configuration:
Basic Setup: Sets the hostname, disables domain lookup, encrypts passwords.
Console and VTY Line Security: Secure access configurations for console and VTY lines.
SNMP, NTP, and Syslog: For network management, time synchronization, and logging.
Interface Configuration: Assigns IP addresses to interfaces and brings them up.
Routing Protocol: Example with OSPF; adjust as per your network's routing protocol.
NAT: Network Address Translation configuration if the router is connecting an internal network to an external network.
DHCP: If the router is acting as a DHCP server.
Security: SSH configuration for secure remote access and basic ACL setup.
Quality of Service: Example QoS policy for prioritizing voice traffic.
Customization and Considerations:
Tailor to Network Needs: Adjust interface numbers, IP addresses, and routing configurations as per your network topology.
Security Compliance: Ensure all configurations comply with your organization's security policies.
Update and Maintenance: Regularly update the router's firmware and review configurations for any necessary changes.
