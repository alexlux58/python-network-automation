!Access Layer ACLs:
!At the access layer, ACLs typically focus on restricting access to the network and protecting end devices.

! Deny unauthorized access to the network
access-list 101 deny ip any host 192.168.1.0
! Permit specific traffic to the network
access-list 101 permit tcp any host 192.168.1.100 eq 80
! Permit all other traffic
access-list 101 permit ip any any

!Distribution Layer ACLs:
!The distribution layer is where you implement most of your network policies, filtering traffic from the access layer to the core.

! Block specific traffic from entering the core network
access-list 102 deny tcp any any eq telnet
access-list 102 deny icmp any any
! Allow other traffic to the core network
access-list 102 permit ip any any

!Core Layer ACLs:
!Core layer ACLs are typically minimal to ensure high throughput. The focus is on protecting the core infrastructure without impacting performance.

! Protect core infrastructure devices
access-list 103 deny ip any host 10.0.0.1
access-list 103 permit ip any any

!Data Center/Services Layer ACLs:
!ACLs at this layer protect critical servers and services, such as web servers, databases, and application servers.

! Restrict access to critical servers
access-list 104 deny ip any host 10.0.1.10
access-list 104 permit tcp any host 10.0.1.20 eq 443
access-list 104 permit ip any any
